1. What is called time complexity.? 
---
So lets say i have taken a code and i will run that code in two diffrent machines like the old machine and the new one
suppose in the old machine it takes neraly 10sec and in the new one it takes nearly 5sec. so the actual time taken to complete the 
execution  of the code like 10sec and 5sec this is known as Time Complexity ... but no this is not actuallu called Time Complexity. 

so the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input given is called Time Complexity. It actually depend on the input because if we have 
given a big input then eventually it will take more time
