Higher Order Function :- A function which accept another function as an argument is known as Higher Order Function .. 

Callback Function : A function which is being passed to another function as an argument is known as callback function 

Higher order function accepts it. and callback is passed into an function that too as an argument. 

for example: 
------------
arrayOne = [10,20,30,40,50]

const data = arrayOne.map(function getElement(element){
    return element*2
})

console.log(data)

so here map is a higher order function. 
getElement is an callback function. 


Callback Hell: 
--------------
callback hell is known for its dis-advantage instead of advantages because callback hell is a readibility problem which is a minor problem , because there is something else which is much more bigger problem then this readibility problem and that is known as inversion of control where we are going the give power to someone else to the third person which will eventually create a big problem.
