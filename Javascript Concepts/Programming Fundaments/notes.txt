Variables:
-----------
Variables are used as a container in javascript where we can store our data/values and values can be 
string,numbers and other datatypes.

There are some rules how to declare a variables Like: 
    1. we cannot use special characters to declare a variable like(#,$)
    2. its good to use camalCase while declaring a variable. 
    3. we can declare variable using var, let, cont. 
    4. Vriables ka start digit se nahi ho sakhta
    5. cannot declare variables using (let, var, const) 
        let var = "name" => this is wrong

Declaring a Variables:
----------------------
Javascript allow us to declare Variables in three diffrent ways like (var, let and const)
but all of them work very diffrently in javascript. 

var name = "deepak"
let name = "deepak"
const name = "deepak"

we will study later during learning scope that how all of these are work diffrently in Javascript.
