Variables:
-----------
Variables are used as a container in javascript where we can store our data/values and values can be 
string,numbers and other datatypes.

There are some rules how to declare a variables Like: 
    1. we cannot use special characters to declare a variable like(#,$)
    2. its good to use camalCase while declaring a variable. 
    3. we can declare variable using var, let, cont. 
    4. Vriables ka start digit se nahi ho sakhta
        var name1 = "deepak" (right)
        var 1name = "deepak" (wrong)

    5. cannot declare variables using (let, var, const) 
        let var = "name" => this is wrong

    6. we can use _ but cannot use - 
        let user_name = "deepak" (right)
        let user-name = "deepak" (wrong)

    7. Variable names are case sensitive
    8. we cannot declare a variable with keywords(if, else for, let, var, const)

Declaring a Variables:
----------------------
Javascript allow us to declare Variables in three diffrent ways like (var, let and const)
but all of them work very diffrently in javascript. 

var name = "deepak"
let name = "deepak"
const name = "deepak"

we will study later during learning scope that how all of these are work diffrently in Javascript. 

Datatype:
----------
number, string, undefined, boolean
Null : Variable declared and defined but with an empty value. let y = null;

Short Circuting in Javascipt:
------------------------------
And Operator: 
-------------
False False False
False True False
True False False 
True True True

Aggar pehla operand false hai toh dusra operand ko check nahi karega woh hamesha pehle operator ko hi return kare dega 
Aggar peh;e operand true hai then check hoga dusra kya hai jo bhi hoga dusrna wohi return hoga chahe woh true ho ya false .




Or Operator:
-------------
True False True 
True True True 
False True True 
False False False
