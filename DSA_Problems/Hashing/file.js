// let arr = [1,2,1,3,2]
// if i tell you to find out how many times 
    // 1 appear in the array which is 1 time
    // 2 how many times 2 appear in the array it us 2 times
    // how many times 3 appear in the array it is 1 time 
// so i can find out thing buy calculating uts frequency mean how many times it is actually present

// remember we have done it before like if the element is not present then its frequency is 1 because it appear for the first time and again when it comes it will just add +1 to the frequency so like this also we can find out that how many times it is present. 


// but lets do the same thing with the help of hashing.
